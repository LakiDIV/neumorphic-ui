## About
Neumorphic design combines the elegance of skeuomorphism with modern aesthetics, resulting in visually appealing user interfaces. This repository serves as a playground for experimenting with neumorphic design principles and creating a collection of custom-tuned elements.

## Goals
- Explore and experiment with neumorphic design techniques
- Fine-tune existing HTML elements to adhere to neumorphic principles
- Create a library of reusable neumorphic elements for easy integration into projects

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you're passionate about neumorphic design and want to contribute your own custom elements, enhancements, or bug fixes, feel free to submit a pull request. Please refer to our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.
