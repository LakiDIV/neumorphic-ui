# Neomorphic UI Library

![Neomorphic Design Example](https://github.com/LakiDIV/neumorphic-ui/assets/51769692/cb4c70b5-e209-4b3c-810e-98f884887c71)

Welcome to my personal Neomorphic UI Library project! This library explores the concept of Neomorphism in web design, offering a collection of UI elements with a unique, milky appearance.

## What is Neomorphic Design?

Neomorphic Design, or Neumorphism, is a modern design trend that aims to create soft, realistic interfaces. It emphasizes subtle shadows and highlights to give UI elements a sense of depth, as if they're extruding from or recessed into the background.

## Current State

- The library includes a handful of neomorphic design elements.
- A dark mode is available but may have some bugs.
- This is an open-source personal project, released for others to explore and use.

## Usage

Feel free to use this library in your projects if you find it interesting. Contributions or improvements are welcome if you'd like to help enhance the library.

Enjoy exploring the world of Neomorphic design!
